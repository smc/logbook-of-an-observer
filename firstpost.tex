Life becomes hard nowadays, sitting at home nothing to do makes me read more.

lead writers of today will have to look for something else to do. The interviews of 
important personalities are now live fed by channels. But we will be reading
 a totally different story of what we saw and heard the last day.
For those who cry about the dryness in Malayalam literature, here is the answer. 
People with good level of imagination is now with media. (July 05, 2007)
