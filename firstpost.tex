Life is becoming hard nowadays. Sitting at home doing nothing, makes me read more.
I usually go for novels. But this time I decided to closely follow the top 
reports and articles in news papers. Within a day or two, 
what I understood was that, if these people started writing fiction, then the 
leading writers of today will have to look for something else to do. The interviews of 
important personalities are now live fed by channels. But we will be reading
 a totally different story of what we saw and heard the last day.
For those who cry about the dryness in Malayalam literature, here is the answer. 
People with good level of imagination is now with media.
