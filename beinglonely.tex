\secstar{Being Lonely (its good if it makes you think!!!)}
\vskip 2pt

For me being lonely is the time to think and let your mind gaze through the rich grasslands life. Even when i am in a crowd, sometimes i will go thinking. I never need to be alone to feel alone. Being alone is simply something which happens to me anywhere unpredictable. When I feel like that, what i will try is to draw conclusions on what i observed.

On such an occasion, i was trying to draw conclusions on the truth of GOD. I just tried to think how GOD can be? As he is one capable of driving the whole universe, he will be either somewhere outside the universe at a centralized place or a distributed source. The existance of such a centralized source is something which is beyond imagination and almost impossible when we think that it is having a role in each and everything happening in the whole universe(just think of a big energy source which provides the force for our movements within the earth and for earth to move around the sun and so on). It led me to the conclusion that the force can be something distributed every where in the whole universe(just understand its a simple conclusion by a crooked mind!!! I am ready to believe otherwise if you convince me).

Then also the problem was actually not solved completely. I just kept thinking what can be that distributed source of power be? It should be something associated with each and everything. When i looked in such a sense, it just clicked me that whenever some chemical reaction happens an amount of energy is released. All activities in the universe when thought of can be reduced to simply things which are using energy or things which displaces energy. Energy is the single driving force in all the actions in the universe. All actions are exchanges or conversions of forms of energy!!!

Then I suddenly felt like, is things this simple? But when i started thinking deeply into the facts it appeared to me more clear that, the concept of a single GOD or a group GODS or anything can be rounded off to the definition of it as the ultimate source of energy in the whole universe. Suddenly it appeared something which explains everything to me(may be because it was so simple).

My thoughts then went into the fact that no religion or beliefs are explaining things like this. Then when i thought a little more, i understood that image the god as something like a watchdog and the ultimate jury was a better solution to many problems in the society and answers to a bunch of questions(another of my assumptions!!!cross me if you want, always welcome!!!).

This just a sample of how my thoughts used to go when I am alone(not physically!!!). Please be patient to read more!!!

great thought dude….the one i could identify very well was tht of energy…..if god is energy…then it can be classified as omnipotent omnipresent…..but as u said the humanity likes and most of them can only accept a god hu is a jurry and prosecutor…the god and spirituality in presnt form has only lead the world to chaos and destruction….i believe that the knowledge about god should be expanded……”all great new things were first called a blashphemy”…..all great knowledge too….i recommend u read the book tomorrows god by neale donald…..cheers

Jinesh…. Well written…. But like all da things written in solitude few lines that came from ur thoughts only u alone can interpret the depth of it completely …Yes this question do come across everyones mind regarding the existence and origin of god… Few just let it go by as a passing thought coz once u starts searching for an answer it wud go on from forever till eternity…But the truth is that everyone does belive somewhere that there is some supernatural power that can change their lives no matter what!!! otherwise ppl wudnt turn to god when nothing worldle can save them… Maybe it’s the belief that has been fed into da human race since time immemorial…

But few unlike others gave it a thought.. Liked some interesting interpretations of urs
Lemme quote u “ I just kept thinking what can be that distributed source of power be? It should be something associated with each and everything. When i looked in such a sense, it just clicked me that whenever some chemical reaction happens an amount of energy is released” But dint it occur to you what drove all these chemical reactions?????There must be something thatz causing such an action…..

Well ppl have different concepts of what god is to them… Some feel that its within them…Some feel its all over.. Some worship them… Some bend down to him…
But to u it occurred that “Then when i thought a little more, i understood that image the god as something like a watchdog” But if that was true then how do u explain all da natural disasters???? Where does the floods,volcanos ,tsunamies and hurricane stand??? If he was such a watch dog wud he ever do things to destroy his beautiful creations??? Wudnt he alwayz maintain things in a” picture perfect” way so that nothing messes up with his possesion???

hi Navi,

May be my inabilities in expressing my thoughts at its best in writing made you think like that. As far as i know, nothing in this world happens as it is!!! It happens in an order, a pseudo random order!!! When i thought about this ordering, i found out, the action of energy behind these will explain this better than anything!!! I didn’t write about that because, i thought people will be able to understand that i was thinking mere energy as the friving force behind everything!!!!

cheers
