It has been almost a month after the last note. Considering that the last note took sometime to complete (around 2 weeks), it is still a long time with out any news. A lot happened during this period. My sister went back to the US, and Mom and Aunt came to help me and father. An alumni meeting happened at JNV on December 5\textsuperscript{th}. I was not able to attend. So I sent a message through one of my friends. Got discharged and readmitted for third cycle. Still playing rummy with Father and as of now, around 650 points down. Incidentally, I got one more paper published (Rasagna did all the work. Thanks to him). Since I have around 4 papers on different Pattern Recognition subject, I guess it is high time now that I started reading some basics. Still reading "Orientalism" By Edward W. Said. 

My notes almost always start with some observations I make of myself or from some conversations I had with someone. I am not changing the routine. What really triggered this note is again a conversation with my sister. I gave the 4 chapters I finished so far for her to read and she commented on them. Pointed out some mistakes (mostly spelling/grammar). Then she asked me to write about my nurse friends, the closely built slum like houses beside CMC, etc.
