\secstar{Memories of a Brother}
I still remember the incident when I met Jinesh for the first time.
I was working as a lecturer in MES, during that time(in 2005). Once there was a tutorial and hands on session organized by the 'Open source community' of the college. Since I didn’t know anything about this, I went to attend the session. During the hands on, the tutor was telling the commands very fast, I was struggling. One of the volunteers of the program approached me, and patiently helped me to complete that hands on session. He impressed me a lot at that time itself. And the boy was one other than Jinesh.

After he joined in IIIT, Hyderabad, and started working in Malayalam OCR, (I was also working on the same project), we spent lots of time spent together. We had quiet a few journeys together to attend OCR workshops. His passion towards the language Malayalam and the development of Malayalam computing was quite a lot.
 
The research areas, he worked on are mainly,
- the automatic annotation of Malayalam books - from words to character to symbol level.
- Identification of broken characters,
- little bit of post-processing side of character recognition.
- and more.

He had a clear idea about what he wants to be. That’s why he came and join in IIIT Hyderabad, even though he had a job offer in hand at that time. And he used to like the environment of the college a lot, which made him decide to convert to Ph.D. under Jawahar sir, which didn’t happen though.

One interesting thing that I remember about Jinesh was his passion towards food. Even though the mess food in IIIT, is not that great, he used to pick up a good amount of food and eat it completely. He never used to waste any food saying that its not tasty. This is a habit that I really appreciate (since I cannot follow).
 
------
 
But his sleeping hours had varied a lot, during his stay in IIIT. Since the college never had a strict time-table, some times, some times, he used to follow, US timings, and sometimes, UK timings, for days and months. which I believe now, as one of the reason to spoil his health.

Before, the disease is identified, quite a long time, I was suffering with leg pain and all. When I met him  last time in IIIT Hyderabad, he was showing me a blood test report. He asked me "See this particular value, this is varying a lot from what is needed. Looks like there is some problem". After that, when I called him after 2 weeks, he was in Vellore.
